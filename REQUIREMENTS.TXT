RestMan: Restaurant Manager SRS & Dev Guide
1. System Overview
RestMan is a web platform for restaurant managers and chefs to plan, track, and optimize the usage of grocery items mapped to recipes. It offers real-time inventory visibility, wastage analytics, recipe allocation planning, and precise forecasting—all in a secure, easy-to-use dashboard.

2. Key Capabilities
Two-way mapping between groceries and recipes (many-to-many)

Real-time inventory and wastage tracking

Recipe-wise allocation and forecasting (percent-based, priority, and planned)

Editable tables for fast menu/grocery management

Forecasting: “How many dishes can I make with what’s left?”

Strict user management & security

Actionable, chef-friendly UI

3. Feature Breakdown & Screens
A. Grocery-Centric View
Click on any grocery item (e.g. rice) to see:

Procured on date

Amount in stock

Balance remaining

Wastage reported (with reasons)

Recipewise %-used: For each recipe, % of this grocery already used this month

Recipewise %-forecast: For each recipe, % of this grocery can still be used/produced

B. Recipe-Centric View
Click on any recipe (e.g. fried rice) to see:

List of grocery items used (and per-dish quantities)

Orders sold (this month, this week, etc.)

Possible orders: Based on what’s left in stock

Wastage: Orders returned or wasted

C. Recipe Allocation & Planning
Recipe Wise Allocation button:

Chef/manager can allocate each grocery to recipes by % (set priorities and expected splits)

Monthly forecast entry screen (e.g., “500 fried rice, 300 soup, 200 snacks”)

Calculates total grocery needed per recipe, and overall

D. Menu/Grocery Admin
Add/Edit/Delete menu (“recipes”) or grocery items

Editable table interface for rapid changes

E. User Management
Role-based (manager, chef, viewer, admin)

Secure logins, strict password policies

4. Data Model Overview
Table/Entity	Fields / Description
Users	id, username, password-hash, role
Groceries	id, name, unit, procured_date, initial_amt, current_amt, wastage_amt, wastage_reason
Recipes	id, name, description
RecipeGroceryMap	recipe_id, grocery_id, qty_per_order
MonthlyPlan	recipe_id, planned_orders, month_year, %_allocation
Sales	recipe_id, orders_sold, orders_returned, wastage

5. Tech Stack & Integration Choices
Layer/Phase	Tool/Service	Stack/Model (Recommended)	Notes
Frontend	Retool, Appsmith, or React+Vite	Retool/Appsmith for no-code MVP	Editable tables, dashboards
Styling	TailwindCSS or DaisyUI	Modern, responsive
Backend/API	AWS Lambda + API Gateway, or Supabase	Supabase (Postgres+Auth+API)	100% free for MVP, instant REST API
Database	Supabase (hosted Postgres), or AWS RDS	Postgres (relational)	Simple, scales as needed
Auth	Supabase Auth, Clerk.dev	Supabase Auth recommended	RBAC, security policies built-in
Hosting	Vercel/Netlify for FE, Supabase for API		Easy, free/cheap for MVP
Docs/Specs	Notion, Google Docs, MkDocs		For onboarding/hand-off

6. Dev Roadmap & Integration Steps
Step 1: Data Model Setup
Use Supabase to instantly create tables (Users, Groceries, Recipes, etc.)

Use Supabase’s web UI for schema, triggers (auto-update balance), and RBAC

Step 2: Admin Interfaces
Build grocery/menu item admin as editable tables in Retool or Appsmith

Or use CRUD UI in React with Material Table if needed

Step 3: Inventory & Recipe Views
Build dashboard cards/tables:

Click grocery → show mapping, usage, forecast, wastage

Click recipe → show groceries, orders sold, possible orders, wastage

Step 4: Allocation/Planning
“Recipe wise Allocation” button: opens wizard/modal

Enter planned split for groceries by recipe (% per recipe)

Show real-time calculation of forecast/orders possible

Step 5: Security/User Management
Enable Supabase Auth; assign roles (manager, chef, viewer)

Set up strict password policy and audit log (Supabase has built-in logs)

Step 6: Deployment
Deploy frontend (Retool, Netlify, or Vercel)

API/DB lives on Supabase

Set up custom domain if needed

7. Sample User Stories & Workflows
Story 1: Manager sets the monthly plan

Enters expected orders for each recipe

App shows how much of each grocery is needed

Story 2: Chef allocates groceries

Sets % split of groceries across recipes

Can override based on expected trends (e.g., more fried rice on weekends)

Story 3: Staff tracks usage/wastage

Clicks on rice → sees what’s in stock, where used, wastage, what’s left

Story 4: Owner checks forecast

For each recipe, sees “orders possible” based on groceries left
